boldHeader: THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY NEEDS TO FIGHT BACK.
boldSubheader: But the corporate-backed wing of the party is getting in the way.
introContent: >-
  **We need a Democratic Party that fights for its voters, not just its
  corporate donors.** That's why we helped elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to
  Congress. We need leadership in the Democratic Party that will represent and
  fight for our communities. 


  **In the era of Donald Trump and his billionaire cabinet, we will fight for an
  America that belongs to all its people.** We are unafraid of taking on
  out-of-touch incumbents in primary challenges because we don't need to just
  elect more Democrats, we need to elect better Democrats. It's time to usher in
  a new generation of Democrats who have a bold vision to transform our economy
  and democracy.

      In a modern, moral, wealthy society like the United States, people should
      not be too poor to live with dignity. That means having access to
      healthcare, housing, education, a living wage, a world not destroyed by
      climate change and aggressive wars of choice.

      Polling data demonstrates that the Democratic Party’s base has moved left,
      and voters are ready for a progressive agenda. Though the party elites may
      be “divided” the base is not; they are ready for unabashed progressive
      politicians. — www.futureoftheparty.com
    header: A Platform for America
    htmlContent: >-
      The Democratic Party needs to fight FOR something. Progressive policies
      like Medicare For All, free public college, and marijuana legalization are
      popular with voters. It's time to fight for them.
