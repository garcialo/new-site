introContent: >-
  **Instead of representing the needs of everyday working men and women,** the
  Democratic Party has been asleep at the wheel. Republicans have taken over
  most state legislatures, governorships, Congress, and now the presidency.


  **The solution is having a bold vision that fights for economic, social, and
  racial justice for all Americans**, not the interests of big money donors.

  It’s time to rebuild the Democratic Party to be a party that fights for a bold
  vision that fights for people, not corporations.

      **Representing voters, not donors** — For too long the voices of everyday
      Americans have been undervalued and gone unnoticed in Washington, D.C..
      The people who are traditionally elected to represent, fall short of our
      expectations and get caught in a vicious cycle of pay-for-play politics.
      Justice Democrat candidates are committed stewards of their communities
      and have a deep desire to make positive, progressive change.

      In a modern, moral, wealthy society like the United States, people should
      not be too poor to live with dignity. That means having access to
      healthcare, housing, education, a living wage, a world not destroyed by
      climate change and aggressive wars of choice. 
    header: Social and Economic Justice.
    htmlContent: >-
      The question is not "if," but "how," and "when." Every Justice Democrat is
      fighting for:


      * Access to Jobs and a Living Wage

      * Affordable Housing and a Quality Education

      * Medicare for All

      Because one can not be achieved without the other — it’s the same fight
      for rights.

      Polling data demonstrates that the Democratic Party’s base has moved left,
      and voters are ready for a progressive agenda. Though the party elites may
      be “divided” the base is not; they are ready for unabashed progressive
      politicians. — futureoftheparty.com

      **Research shows that the Democratic establishment’s pivot to the “middle”
      has failed. **It’s time to mobilize the electorate and enact bold,
      progressive policies that will uplift people and communities across the
