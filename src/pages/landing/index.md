boldSubheader: But the corporate-backed wing of the party is getting in the way.
introContent: >-
  **We need a Democratic Party that fights for its voters, not just its
  corporate donors.** That's why we helped elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to
  Congress. We need leadership in the Democratic Party that will represent and
  fight for our communities. 


  **In the era of Donald Trump and his billionaire cabinet, we will fight for an
  America that belongs to all its people. **We are unafraid of taking on
  out-of-touch incumbents in primary challenges because we don't need to just
  elect more Democrats, we need to elect better Democrats. It's time to usher in
  a new generation of Democrats who have a bold vision to transform our economy
  and democracy.

      **Representing voters, not donors** — For too long the voices of everyday
      Americans have been undervalued and gone unnoticed in Washington, D.C..
      The people who are traditionally elected to represent, fall short of our
      expectations and get caught in a vicious cycle of pay-for-play politics.
      Justice Democrat candidates are committed stewards of their communities
      and have a deep desire to make positive, progressive change.

      In a modern, moral, wealthy society like the United States, people should
      not be too poor to live with dignity. That means having access to
      healthcare, housing, education, a living wage, a world not destroyed by
      climate change and aggressive wars of choice.

    htmlContent: >-
      The question is not "if," but "how," and "when." Every Justice Democrat is
      fighting for:


      * Access to Jobs and a Living Wage

      * Affordable Housing and a Quality Education

      * Medicare for All

      Because one can not be achieved without the other — it’s the same fight
      for rights.

      Polling data demonstrates that the Democratic Party’s base has moved left,
      and voters are ready for a progressive agenda. Though the party elites may
      be “divided” the base is not; they are ready for unabashed progressive
      politicians. — futureoftheparty.com

      **Research shows that the Democratic establishment’s pivot to the “middle”
      has failed. **It’s time to mobilize the electorate and enact bold,
      progressive policies that will uplift people and communities across the
      country.
